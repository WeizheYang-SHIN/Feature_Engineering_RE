# Feature_Engineering_RE
Sentence structural and semantic information are important for relation extraction. This program provides a method of obtaing sentence information based on feature engineering and neural networks.  Main content is utilizing entity-related features to construct combined feature.The neural network model we used in our research is BERT model.

The steps for running:

1.Excuting "python main_train.py" will start a trainning programming.

2.Excuting "python main_predict.py" will start a predicting programming.

  Or excuting "python Excute_main_predict.py" will start an automic programming for predicting under the newest model.
